<h2>scite-debug Introduction</h2>
<p>
<code>scite-debug</code> is written entirely in SciTE Lua, which is standard 5.1 compatible. The only bit of C which is absolutely essential is the <em>spawner</em>, which captures an interactive command-line debugger like GDB, and allows <code>scite-debug</code>
 to write commands to it. Output is directed to a specified global 
function, using an appropriate main thread technique; on Windows, I'm 
passing messages to a wndproc from the debugger thread, and on GTK using
 the asynchronous output mechanism. On both platforms, we grab debugger 
output by full line, which means that there are restrictions in 
debugging interactive programs which issue prompts. However, on the 
Windows side we ask for a separate console window for the debugged 
program, which separates program input and output from debugger output 
and allows debugging of Windows console applications.
</p><p>
It is entirely possible for the debug target not to have any debugging 
symbols. This would be the case when we are only interested in debugging
 shared libraries loaded by the program. So typically we would be 
setting breakpoints in these libraries, but GDB has to be cajoled into 
accepting this. If debug.target starts with '[n]', then GDB will be fed 
an arbitrary little symbol file (provided by stubby.so|.dll). At this 
point, it is happy to accept any unresolved breakpoint requests as <em>pending</em>. (Do note that you need vs 6 of GDB for this; if you are using MinGW, download a fresher GDB if you are still running vs 5.)
</p><p>
Environment variables can be set for the debug target using the <code>debug.environment</code> property. This is a semi-colon separated list of VAR=VAL pairs.
</p><p>
A typical captive debugger session needs to set breakpoints, and start the program running with the parameters specified using <code>View|Parameters</code>.
 Any breakpoints set before the program is run are written out to a 
configuration file; in the case of GDB, it is called 'prompt.cmd'. This 
file is also an opportunity to configure the debugger more to our taste.
 For instance, for GDB we set a prompt with a linefeed, switch off 
output paging, etc.
</p><p>
Stopping on a breakpoint requires a distinct pattern that matches 
debugger output and can extract the file and line. GDB has a special 
mode (-f) which is used by Emacs, which prints out the full path at any 
break in this format: <code>(26)(26)&lt;path&gt;:&lt;line&gt;</code> 
where (26) is the ASCII character represented by decimal 26. This gives a
 very distinct target pattern. Other debuggers are not so amenable to 
being driven automatically, and we have to make do.
</p><p>
Once we are in 'break' mode, it is of course possible to set and unset breakpoints directly.
</p><p>
Any debugger command can be entered from the Output window. For instance, you can set a variable watch in GDB using 'watch var'.
</p><p>
A common task is to evaluate expressions. Alt-I (Inspect) will report the value of the expression at the cursor. <code>scite-debug</code> is intelligent enough to know that <code>a.b</code> and <code>p-&gt;c-&gt;x</code>
 are complete expressions, but if an expression is selected, it will use
 that. Tooltip evaluation uses the same heuristics and the same debugger
 command, but redirects the output to a tooltip rather than to the SciTE
 output window. The output of any command can be redirected to an 
arbitrary function, which opens up interesting opportunities for a more 
graphical interface. (This, however, will have to wait a while.)
</p><p>
For C/C++, <code>scite-debug</code> will notice that an expression 
evaluated as a pointer, and will attempt to deference that pointer. That
 is, if GDB reports the value as <code>$11 = (A *)0xFFF23EE</code> then <code>scite-debug</code> will attempt to evaluate <code>*$11</code> and collect the results.
</p><p>
Another useful feature for C++ debugging is the automatic <em>simplification</em> of certain standard patterns, particularly <code>std::string</code> where it will extract the char pointer value. These rules are applied recursively, so that structures containing <code>std::string</code>
 values will be presented in a much more human-friendly form. Do note 
that these simplifications depend heavily on the precise implementation 
used! Currently only g++ is supported so the pattern is fairly stable. 
This is a good place for user customizations.
</p><p>
<code>scite-debug</code> generally knows how to interpret a stack trace;
 double-clicking on the required level will put you into that frame and 
place you at the corresponding source line. The stack trace can be 
explicitly shown using <code>Ctrl+Alt+S</code> and will automatically presented if possible when an error occurs. <code>Alt+U</code> and <code>Alt+D</code> correspond to 'up' and 'down' levels.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Integrated Lua and C/C++ debugging</h2>
<p>
This useful (and possibly unique) feature is implemented by running the clidebug Lua debugger in a process within GDB. <code>clidebug</code> has now got a 'GDB mode', where it mimics the GDB command set and output. So whether we break in GDB or <code>clidebug</code>, <code>luagdb</code> will take us to that place in the source.
</p><p>
There are two scenarios possible; the first is that the host program is 
Lua itself (or a close relative), and understands the -e and -l command 
line options; this is the default. The second is that the host is a 
program which has embedded Lua. The debug.target variable must indicate 
both the host program and the Lua script name. Some examples may clarify
 this:
</p><p>
</p><pre># the host is Lua on the path, and has no debugging symbols.
debug.target=[n]:gdb;lua;mytest.lua

# the host is SciTE - the [h] indicates that it isn't Lua
debug.target=[n]:gdb;SciTE[h];/home/steve/{{scite-debug}}/extman.lua

# a debug version of Lua.
debug.target=:gdb;/home/steve/lua-5.1.3/src/lua;/home/steve/tests/testlfs.lua
</pre>
<p>
If the host isn't Lua, then you must initialize clidebug yourself in the
 script to be debugged. In this snippet, replace the path with the 
appropriate location.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="code"><span class="keyword">local</span> path = <span class="string">';/home/steve/{{scite-debug}}/lua_clidebugger/?.'</span>
<span class="library">package.path</span> = <span class="library">package.path</span> .. path .. <span class="string">'lua'</span>
<span class="library">package.cpath</span> = <span class="library">package.cpath</span> .. path .. <span class="string">'so'</span>
WIN=<span class="keyword">false</span>
GDB=<span class="keyword">true</span>
<span class="library">require</span> <span class="string">"debugger"</span>
<span class="library">io.stdout</span>:setvbuf(<span class="string">"no"</span>)
pause(<span class="string">'debug'</span>)
</pre>

<p>
Debugging a GUI program like SciTE on Windows requires a special build, 
at least if you want to debug Lua scripts. Normally GUI programs 
('subsystem:windows') do not have standard in and out, but they can be 
rebuilt. In the case of SciTE, I replaced '-mwindows' with '-lgdi32 
-lcommctl32'; the resulting program comes with an ugly black console, 
but this will be hidden by the debugger.
</p><p>
(Another option for debugging Lua-only for GUI applications is <code>remDebug</code>, which is also supported by <code>scite-debug</code>.)
</p><p>
</p><h2>Single-stepping into C/C++</h2>
<p>
<code>luagdb</code> makes it possible to single-step into C extensions 
from Lua code. To do this, it is necessary to find the address of the 
particular C function we are entering on the 'call' debugger event. A 
little extension, <code>dbgl</code>, queries the Lua internals and returns this address. It also provides a convenient function to put breakpoints called <code>debug_break()</code> (this trick requires a GDB version that is fine with pending breakpoints.) <code>clidebug</code> prints out this address with a distinct prefix, and calls <code>dbgl.debug_break()</code>, which puts us into GDB. <code>luagdb</code>
 picks up the address and issues a GDB 'info line' query on the address 
to see if any debug information is available for that address. If so, it
 makes a temporary breakpoint at the start of this function. Either way,
 it then issues a 'continue' command so that we keep going. We cache the
 result of this so, so we don't have to continuously call 'info line', 
but we still set temporary breakpoints each time the program is 
single-stepping from Lua to C/C++. This ensures that it is always 
possible to step over a C function.
</p><p>
Once you are on the C/C++ side, you can continue single-stepping in Lua by simply continuing (Alt+R.)
</p><p>
These are still two separate debug sessions, so there are some 
limitations. Setting breakpoints in a running program can cause 
interesting problems, at least on Windows. There is no integrated call 
stack.
</p><p>
<code>dbgl.c</code> has to find out what the corresponding address of a Lua C function:
</p><p>
</p><pre>static int c_addr (lua_State *L)
{
    char buff[40];
    CallInfo *ci;
    Closure* cl = NULL;
    for (ci = L-&gt;ci - 1; ci &gt; L-&gt;base_ci; ci--) {
      if (! f_isLua(ci)) {  // C function!
        cl = clvalue(ci-&gt;func);	
      	break;
      }
    }
    if (cl == NULL) {
      lua_pushnil(L);
    } else {
      void *fun = cl-&gt;c.f;    
      sprintf(buff,"0x%X",fun);
      lua_pushstring(L,buff);
    }
    return 1;
}
</pre>
<p>
This requires some knowledge of the internals of Lua, and requires <code>lstate.h</code>, which is not part of the public API. (So when rebuilding <code>dbgl.c</code>, you need to give it an include path that points to the <em>full</em> set of Lua headers.) We look down through the stack of closures to find the C function we are calling.
