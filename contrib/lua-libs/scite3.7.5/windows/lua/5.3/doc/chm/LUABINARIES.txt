This source code is distributed by the LuaBinaries project:

No changes are made to the Lua.org source code, 
except for the "luaconf.h" file, where the LUA_CPATH_DEFAULT is complemented.

All binaries are generated using our own Makefiles, 
but following the same directives of the original Makefiles.

Best Regards,
LuaBinaries Team
