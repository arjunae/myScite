--- Lua Extensions ---

Platform: 
	win32 / win64

Usage: 
	-	Edit self descriptive config.txt 
	-	start make.all.mingw.bat
	-	Its also possible to build a specific lib by starting the make batch within its folder. 

Notes:
	Rename the clib64 folder to clib for 64Bit builds with Msys2-64 and put you msys/mingw64 into path instead.	
	Not perfect, but does the trick.
