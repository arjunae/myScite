# Scintillua

## Overview

Scintillua adds dynamic [Lua][] [LPeg][] lexers to [Scintilla][]. It is the
quickest way to add new or customized syntax highlighting and code folding for
programming languages to any Scintilla-based text editor or IDE. Scintillua was
designed to be dropped into or compiled with any Scintilla environment.

Scintillua may also be used as a Lua library for obtaining syntax highlighting
information of source code snippets.

[Lua]: http://lua.org
[LPeg]: http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/lpeg.html
[Scintilla]: http://scintilla.org

## Features

* Drop-in installation in most Scintilla environments -- no modifications to
  Scintilla are necessary.
* Support for over 90 programming languages.
* Easy lexer embedding for multi-language lexers.
* Universal color themes.
* Comparable speed to native Scintilla lexers.
* Can be used as a Lua library (Scintilla is not required).

## Requirements

Scintillua only requires Scintilla 2.25 or greater. Lua and LPeg have been
pre-compiled into the external lexer and you can download their source files
using the links above should you choose to compile Scintillua directly into a
Scintilla-based application.

When used a Lua library, Scintillua requires Lua 5.1 or greater and
[LPeg][] 0.12 or greater.

## Download

Download Scintillua from the project's [download page][] or from these quick
links:

Stable Builds

* [Win32 and Linux][]

Unstable Builds

* [Win32 and Linux Nightly][]

_Warning_: nightly builds are untested, may have bugs, and are the absolute
cutting-edge versions of Scintillua. Do not use them in production, but for
testing purposes only.

If necessary, you can obtain PGP signatures from the [download page][] along
with a public key in order to verify download integrity. For example on Linux,
after importing the public key via `gpg --import foicica.pgp` and downloading
the appropriate signature, run `gpg --verify [signature]`.
