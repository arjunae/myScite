The <code>deferred.then()</code> method, which replaces it, should be used instead.</p>\n    <p>The <code>deferred.pipe()</code> method returns a new promise that filters the status and values of a deferred through a function.  The <code>doneFilter</code> and <code>failFilter</code> functions filter the original deferred's resolved / rejected status and values. <strong>As of jQuery 1.7</strong>, the method also accepts a <code>progressFilter</code> function to filter any calls to the original deferred's <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyWith</code> methods. These filter functions can return a new value to be passed along to the piped promise's <code>done()</code> or <code>fail()</code> callbacks, or they can return another observable object (Deferred, Promise, etc) which will pass its resolved / rejected status and values to the piped promise's callbacks. If the filter function used is <code>null</code>, or not specified, the piped promise will be resolved or rejected with the same values as the original.</p>\n  "}]}
