The <code>doneFilter</code> and <code>failFilter</code> functions filter the original deferred's resolved / rejected status and values. The <code>progressFilter</code> function filters any calls to the original deferred's <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyWith</code> methods. These filter functions can return a new value to be passed along to the promise's <code>.done()</code> or <code>.fail()</code> callbacks, or they can return another observable object (Deferred, Promise, etc) which will pass its resolved / rejected status and values to the promise's callbacks. If the filter function used is <code>null</code>, or not specified, the promise will be resolved or rejected with the same values as the original.</p>\n\n    <p>Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Since\n      <code>deferred.then</code> returns a Promise, other methods of the\n      Promise object can be chained to this one, including additional\n      <code>.then()</code> methods.\n    </p>\n  "}]}
