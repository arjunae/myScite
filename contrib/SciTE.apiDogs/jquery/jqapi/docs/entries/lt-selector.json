They narrow the set down based on the order of the elements within this matched set.

This is why <code>$( \".myclass:lt(1)\" )</code> selects the first element in the document with the class <code>myclass</code>, rather than selecting no elements. In contrast, <code>:nth-child(n)</code> uses <em>1-based indexing</em> to conform to the CSS specification.</p>\n    <p>Prior to jQuery 1.8, the <code>:lt(index)</code> selector did <em>not</em> accept a negative value for <code>index</code></p>\n  "}],"slug":"lt-selector"}
