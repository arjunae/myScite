The second two forms, introduced in jQuery 1.7, are identical to <code>.on()</code> except that the handler is removed after the first time the event occurs at the delegated element, whether the selector matched anything or not. For example:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#foo\" ).one( \"click\", function() {\n  alert( \"This will be displayed only once.\" );\n});\n$( \"body\" ).one( \"click\", \"#foo\", function() {\n  alert( \"This displays if #foo is the first thing clicked in the body.\" );\n});\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>After the code is executed, a click on the element with ID <code>foo</code> will display the alert. Subsequent clicks will do nothing. This code is equivalent to:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#foo\" ).on( \"click\", function( event ) {\n  alert( \"This will be displayed only once.\" );\n  $( this ).off( event );\n});\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>In other words, explicitly calling <code>.off()</code> from within a regularly-bound handler has exactly the same effect.</p>\n    <p>If the first argument contains more than one space-separated event types, the event handler is called <em>once for each event type</em>.</p>\n  "}]}
