It is roughly equivalent to <code>$.get(url, data, success)</code> except that it is a method rather than global function and it has an implicit callback function.  When a successful response is detected (i.e. when <code>textStatus</code> is \"success\" or \"notmodified\"), <code>.load()</code> sets the HTML contents of the matched element to the returned data. This means that most uses of the method can be quite simple:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#result\" ).load( \"ajax/test.html\" );\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>If no element is matched by the selector — in this case, if the document does not contain an element with id=\"result\" — the Ajax request will <em>not</em> be sent.</p>\n    <h4 id=\"callback-function\">Callback Function</h4>\n    <p>If a \"complete\" callback is provided, it is executed after post-processing and HTML insertion has been performed. The callback is fired once for each element in the jQuery collection, and <code>this</code> is set to each DOM element in turn.</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#result\" ).load( \"ajax/test.html\", function() {\n  alert( \"Load was performed.\" );\n});\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>In the two examples above, if the current document does not contain an element with an ID of \"result,\" the <code>.load()</code> method is not executed.</p>\n    <h4 id=\"request-method\">Request Method</h4>\n    <p>The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed.</p>\n    <h4 id=\"loading-page-fragments\">Loading Page Fragments</h4>\n    <p>The <code>.load()</code> method, unlike <code><a href=\"/jQuery.get/\">$.get()</a></code>, allows us to specify a portion of the remote document to be inserted. This is achieved with a special syntax for the <code>url</code> parameter. If one or more space characters are included in the string, the portion of the string following the first space is assumed to be a jQuery selector that determines the content to be loaded.   </p>\n    <p>We could modify the example above to use only part of the document that is fetched:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#result\" ).load( \"ajax/test.html #container\" );\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>When this method executes, it retrieves the content of <code>ajax/test.html</code>, but then jQuery parses the returned document to find the element with an ID of <code>container</code>. This element, along with its contents, is inserted into the element with an ID of <code>result</code>, and the rest of the retrieved document is discarded.</p>\n    <p>jQuery uses the browser's <code>.innerHTML</code> property to parse the retrieved document and insert it into the current document. During this process, browsers often filter elements from the document such as <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> elements. As a result, the elements retrieved by <code>.load()</code> may not be exactly the same as if the document were retrieved directly by the browser.</p>\n    <h4 id=\"script-execution\">Script Execution</h4>\n    <p> When calling <code>.load()</code> using a URL without a suffixed selector expression, the content is passed to <code>.html()</code> prior to scripts being removed. This executes the script blocks before they are discarded. If <code>.load()</code> is called with a selector expression appended to the URL, however, the scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updated, and thus are <em>not</em> executed. An example of both cases can be seen below:</p>\n    <p>Here, any JavaScript loaded into <code>#a</code> as a part of the document will successfully execute.</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#a\" ).load( \"article.html\" );\n    </code></pre>\n    <p>However, in the following case, script blocks in the document being loaded into <code>#b</code> are stripped out and not executed:</p>\n    <pre><code>\n$( \"#b\" ).load( \"article.html #target\" );\n    </code></pre>\n  "}]}
