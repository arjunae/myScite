-- Exuberant CTAGS for Windows --
...with additional c related patches and enabled wildcard support. 

Im including the original Exuberant CTAGS here, because of its small size, speed and the incredible high SteamPunk Factor.
Maybe that will change if universal ctags have a first stable with reasonable sized binaries.
